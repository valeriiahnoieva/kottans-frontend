### 0.Git Basics - DONE
As I`m a complete newbie in coding and development, all information from these resources was new to me. Branching surprised me most because it gives an opportunity to create a new line of development and I will definitely use it in the future.

As I`ve mentioned before, all information is new to me, beacause I have no experience in development. What surprised me most is the content of 2 articles about HTTP, as I have never thought before what makes web work and now I`m interested enough to learn more on this topic.
