### 0.Git Basics - DONE
As I`m a complete newbie in coding and development, all information from these resources was new to me. Branching surprised me most because it gives an opportunity to create a new line of development and I will definitely use it in the future.

As I've mentioned before, all information is new to me, beacause I have no experience in development. What surprised me most is the content of 2 articles about HTTP, as I have never thought before what makes web work and now I'm interested enough to learn more on this topic.

## Git Collaboration

Udacity GitHub and Collaboration course provided me tons of knowledge about collaborative work with other developers using remote repo. This info was new to me as in the previous Git Basics course I have learned only how to work with my own repo and Git key principles. Completing new tasks of Learn Git Branching gave me deeper understanding of such git commands, as git pull, git fetch, git push and git rebase. I`m very thankful to mentors responsible for choosing learning materials as studying absolutely new topic has never been easier for me. All this info I am going to use in future as development is all about collaboration.
